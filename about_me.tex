I have found a great interest in system level programming and optimizations.
At the University of Toronto I took a course called "Operating Systems", which
proved to be one of my favorite courses. So much so, that I am currently working
on a bachelors thesis in accelerator based computing with the Risc-V process architecture.

When I have free time on my hands I enjoy spending it actively. I just got back to playing football,
after having suffered a broken ankel. Furthermore, I enjoy going to the gym somewhat regularly.
