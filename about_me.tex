I am a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Copenhagen with a
knack for problem-solving and system levels programming.I have practical
experience developing and implementing software projects, complemented by a
passion for exploring innovative solutions through personal endeavors. I am
eager to contribute my skills to challenging projects and continuously learn new
technologies. 

With my free time I enjoy being active. Whether that would be going to
the gym a couple of times per week, climbing with friends or playing football
whenever there the Science Cup is available at my University.
