\small{I am a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Copenhagen with a
	enjoyment for problem-solving. I have practical experience developing and
	implementing software projects, and a passion for exploring innovative solutions
	through personal work. I enjoy working on challenging projects, and look forward
	to provide help on one of yours.

	In my free time, I enjoy being active. This includes both football events with
	the University, as well as going to the gym on a regular basis.
