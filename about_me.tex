I am a Computer Science student at the University of Copenhagen specializing in
systems-level programming. I combine academic theory with practical
application, building software through both courses and personal projects. I
enjoy applying my technical skills to complex challenges and learn new
technologies.

Outside of the lecture hall, I prioritize an active lifestyle. I enjoy regular
gym sessions and competing in the University’s Science
Cup football tournament when available.
