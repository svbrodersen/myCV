	\href{https://github.com/NiklasPfister/adaXT}{\emph{adaXT}} is a Python module
	for tree-based machine-learning algorithms that is fast, adaptable and
	extendable. It aims to provide researchers a more flexible workflow when
	developing tree-based models.

	Throughout this project I learned to work with a team, and got a deep
	understanding for tree-based machine-learning methods.
