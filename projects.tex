  \small{
    During my time at UofT, I helped in creating a movie list project. The project was written in Java,
    and made used of the omdp API to fetch movies, such that users could see ratings before choosing
    if they wanted to add the movie to a watchlist. Furthermore, users were able to add their own personal
    ratings to the movies seperate of the official ratings.
